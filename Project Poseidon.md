# **Poseidon Stage-1 Master Plan**

## **The 10/10 Maritime Domain Awareness Solution**

## **Core Strategy: Progressive Sophistication**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3):** Rock-solid baseline that works perfectly **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6):** Strategic enhancements targeting specific metrics  
 **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8):** Competition-grade polish and failsafe systems

---

## **Technical Architecture**

### **1\. Detection Pipeline (Targeting AP50 \= 50% weight)**

**Baseline Detector:**

* **YOLOv8x** fine-tuned separately on EO and SAR  
* Proven architecture, extensive documentation, robust inference  
* Pre-trained on COCO → transfer learning advantage

**EO Processing Chain:**

Raw Sentinel-2 → Cloud masking (SCL band) → Normalization → 640x640 tiles → YOLOv8-EO → NMS

**SAR Processing Chain:**

Raw Sentinel-1 → Speckle filtering → dB conversion → Normalization → 640x640 tiles → YOLOv8-SAR → NMS

**Advanced Enhancement (Phase 2):**

* **Ensemble averaging** of EO and SAR predictions (when both available)  
* **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)** \- 4 rotations \+ flips  
* **Multi-scale detection** \- 3 different input resolutions  
* **Confidence calibration** using temperature scaling on validation set

### **2\. Vessel Classification (Missing requirement addressed)**

**Three-class system:**

1. Commercial vessels (cargo, tanker, passenger)  
2. Vessels of interest (fishing, military, unknown)  
3. Other (recreational, service)

**Implementation:**

* **Classification head** added to YOLOv8 (detection \+ classification in one pass)  
* Training on vessel type annotations from xView dataset  
* **Aspect ratio \+ size features** as backup classifier for edge cases

### **3\. AIS Correlation (Targeting F1 \= 30% weight)**

**Smart Matching Algorithm:**

def correlate\_ais\_detections(detections, ais\_data, image\_timestamp):  
    \# Phase 1: Temporal gating (±30 minutes)  
    ais\_candidates \= filter\_by\_time(ais\_data, image\_timestamp, window=30)  
      
    \# Phase 2: Spatial gating (adaptive radius based on vessel speed)  
    matches \= \[\]  
    for detection in detections:  
        for ais\_point in ais\_candidates:  
            distance \= haversine(detection.lat\_lon, ais\_point.lat\_lon)  
            max\_distance \= calculate\_max\_distance(ais\_point.speed, time\_window=30)  
              
            if distance \<= max\_distance:  
                confidence \= calculate\_match\_confidence(distance, time\_diff, speed\_consistency)  
                matches.append((detection, ais\_point, confidence))  
      
    \# Phase 3: Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment  
    return hungarian\_assignment(matches)

**Advanced Enhancement (Phase 2):**

* **Kalman filter tracking** for vessel state estimation  
* **Speed/course consistency** scoring in match confidence  
* **Multi-hypothesis tracking** for ambiguous cases

### **4\. Path Interpolation (Targeting RMSE \= 20% weight)**

**Physics-Based Interpolation:**

def interpolate\_vessel\_path(sparse\_ais\_points):  
    \# Phase 1: Linear interpolation with speed constraints  
    base\_path \= linear\_interpolation\_with\_physics(sparse\_ais\_points)  
      
    \# Phase 2: Smooth with cubic spline (enforces realistic accelerations)  
    smooth\_path \= cubic\_spline\_smooth(base\_path, tension=0.1)  
      
    \# Phase 3: Land avoidance using coastline buffer  
    final\_path \= avoid\_land\_intersections(smooth\_path, coastline\_buffer=1km)  
      
    return final\_path

**Advanced Enhancement (Phase 2):**

* **Constant Turn Rate and Speed (CTRS) model** for realistic vessel dynamics  
* **Weather/current compensation** using historical patterns (offline lookup tables)  
* **Uncertainty quantification** to weight interpolation confidence

### **5\. Land Masking & Geo-Processing**

**Robust Land Masking:**

* **Natural Earth coastline** → 100m buffered polygons  
* **Pre-computed mask tiles** for all possible Sentinel scenes  
* **Conservative masking** \- exclude detections within 200m of coast

**Coordinate Handling:**

* **Geodesic calculations** for all distance measurements  
* **CRS transformation pipeline** with error checking  
* **Bounding box validation** \- ensure no invalid geometries

## **Data Strategy**

### **Training Data Preparation**

**Datasets (in order of priority):**

1. **xView vessel detection** \- 190k vessel annotations (primary)  
2. **Sentinel vessel detection** \- Zenodo dataset (domain-specific)  
3. **HRSC2016** \- ship classification labels  
4. **Marine Cadastre AIS** \- real-world correlation examples

**Data Augmentation Pipeline:**

* **Geometric:** rotation (±45°), flip, scale (0.8-1.2x)  
* **Photometric:** brightness (±20%), contrast (±15%), gamma (0.8-1.2)  
* **SAR-specific:** speckle simulation, multiplicative noise  
* **Atmospheric:** synthetic cloud/haze overlay for EO

**Validation Strategy:**

* **Stratified 5-fold CV** on training data  
* **Geographic holdout** \- reserve specific regions for validation  
* **Temporal holdout** \- reserve recent dates for validation  
* **Mock test simulation** \- identical format to competition evaluation
